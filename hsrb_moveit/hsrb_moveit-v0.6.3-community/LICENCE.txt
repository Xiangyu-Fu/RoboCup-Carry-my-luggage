NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY TMC OR A TMC AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE COMMUNITY SOFTWARE OR SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

Article 7: Liability

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL TMC BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF DATA, FAILURE TO TRANSMIT OR RECEIVE ANY DATA OR INFORMATION, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COMMUNITY SOFTWARE OR SERVICES OR ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE OR APPLICATIONS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COMMUNITY SOFTWARE OR SERVICES, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF TMC HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event, shall TMC's total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.

Article 8: Misuse or Use Outside the License Terms

You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless TMC and its officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs or expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and the costs of enforcing any right to indemnification hereunder in connection with any claim, suit, action or proceeding by a third party that arises out of or relates to any: allegation of facts that, if true, would constitute Community Member’s breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations under this License, including, but not limited to, a violation of the license grant; or any act or omission by You, any third party acting on behalf of You, connection with this License.

Article 9: Independent Contractor

Nothing in this License creates any agency, joint venture, partnership or other form of joint enterprise, employment or fiduciary relationship between the parties. Neither party has any express or implied right or authority to assume or create any obligations on behalf of or in the name of the other party or to bind the other party to any contract, agreement or undertaking with any third party.

Article 10: Personal License

Any purported assignment, delegation or transfer in violation of this License is void. This License is binding upon and inures to the benefit of the parties hereto.

Article 11: Controlling Law

This License will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Japan without regard to its choice of law or conflicts of law principles. This License shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded.  Any proceedings regarding this License will be conducted solely in a court of appropriate jurisdiction in Tokyo, Japan and in the Japanese language.

Article 12: Entire Agreement

This License constitutes the complete statement of all mutual understandings between TMC and You with respect to the Community Software. This License and the HSR Research Agreement should be construed to avoid any conflicts. If a court of competent jurisdiction holds that a conflict is unavoidable, the terms and conditions of the HSR Research Agreement shall prevail. This License supersedes and prevails over any terms of any agreement between Community Member and Collaborator as it relates to the Community Software. The headings used in this agreement are solely for the convenience of the parties and do not limit the construction of this License, which will be considered as a whole.
